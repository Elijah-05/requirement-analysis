# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

## 📖 Introduction  
This repository provides a detailed explanation of **Requirement Analysis**, a critical phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.  

The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Define what Requirement Analysis is.  
- Highlight its importance in building successful software.  
- Document the processes, types, and benefits of Requirement Analysis.  

This repo will serve as both a **learning resource** and a **reference guide** for students, developers, and teams who want to understand and apply Requirement Analysis effectively in their projects.

## 🔎 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, understanding, and documenting what a software system should accomplish before development begins.  
It is one of the most important stages in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it lays the foundation for design, coding, testing, and delivery.

Rather than jumping straight into building the system, teams take time to work with stakeholders—such as clients, end users, and project managers—to clarify expectations and define both the **functional** (what the system must do) and **non-functional** (how the system should perform) requirements.

### 📌 Why Requirement Analysis Matters
- **Clear Understanding:** Aligns developers and stakeholders on the goals and expectations of the system.  
- **Well-defined Scope:** Establishes boundaries that help prevent *scope creep* and wasted effort.  
- **Accurate Planning:** Enables realistic estimation of cost, time, and resources needed.  
- **Quality Assurance:** Increases the likelihood that the finished product truly meets user needs.  
- **Reduced Risks:** Identifies potential issues early, before they become costly problems.

### 📌 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. **Gathering Requirements** – Collecting information from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation.  
2. **Eliciting Details** – Digging deeper into expectations using brainstorming, prototyping, or focus group discussions.  
3. **Documenting Requirements** – Writing clear specifications, user stories, and use cases to ensure no detail is overlooked.  
4. **Analyzing and Modeling** – Prioritizing needs, checking feasibility, and creating models or diagrams to visualize the system.  
5. **Validating Requirements** – Reviewing the documented needs with stakeholders to confirm accuracy and completeness.

### 📌 Functional vs. Non-functional Requirements
- **Functional Requirements:** Define *what the system should do*.  
  *Example: A user must be able to search for items and place an order.*  
- **Non-functional Requirements:** Define *how the system should behave*.  
  *Example: The system should respond to searches within 2 seconds and handle at least 1,000 users at once.*

✅ In summary, Requirement Analysis ensures that the **right problem is being solved** before a single line of code is written. By clarifying expectations early, it increases efficiency, reduces risks, and helps deliver software that meets both business objectives and user needs.
